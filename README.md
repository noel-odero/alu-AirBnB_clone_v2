### HBNB - The Console

This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. The project aims to implement a backend interface, or console, to manage program data, allowing users to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. The system uses JSON serialization/deserialization, making storage persistent between sessions.

The project includes tasks such as making BaseModel, updating BaseModel with kwargs, creating FileStorage class, adding basic functionality, updating the console with methods, creating user class, more classes, and updating file storage.

To use the project, first clone the repository and locate the "console.py" file. Then, run the command "/AirBnB_clone$./console.py" to display the "HBnB" console.

Commands available within the console program include create, destroy, show, all, update, and quit. Users can also use an alternative syntax,.([[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]]), for more advanced commands.

Examples include creating an object, destroying an object, updating an object, and deleting a user. The project also provides a system of JSON serialization/deserialization for persistent storage between sessions.
